Hi there grading person! This is Declan Behan speaking. I'm not sure what you wanted in term so 
documentation but for my above an beyond I did a modal box that 
ask if you want to enable a lightshow for the first song. 
If you choose yes the visuallizer changes to the music based on the part of the song. 
I didnt have time to implemented that programaticaly so it was manually scripted.

Any code that i referenced is siteied in the comments. most of it was W3 tutorials.

1 Function
	- I have a audio controller with progress indicator
	- I have 4 Sliders, 6 Checkboxes, and 7 Radio buttons. amonster other things.
	- I have a Song Picker and Fullscreen Button

2 UI/UX
	- Custom CSS Grid Layout
	- Each UI Element is simply labeled.

3 Canvas API Stuff
	- I have an Invert option
	- Wave shows waveform data, the rest show frequnecy data.
	- Visualizers:
		- Bars 
		- Circles
		- Wave
		- Line
		- Beatsaber Cube
	- I use the state vars
	- I save and load the context for the Beatsaber visualizer
	- Looks nice!

4 Web Audio
	- Wave shows waveform data, the rest show frequnecy data.
	- Filter node options included
	- Sounds nice!
